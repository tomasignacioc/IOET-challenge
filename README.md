<h1>Tomas Contreras solution</h1>

To make this script work, all the employee schedules should be stored as a .txt file inside a folder called
"employee_schedule". The script reads the file names as well as the content, and manages the data to print
the desired output.

The approach for this solution was store the data inside objects and manipulate it from there.
I created functions that will read file names, file content and create an array storing employees names and schedules as
objects.

    <code>node index.js</code>
